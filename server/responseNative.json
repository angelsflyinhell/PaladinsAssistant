    Lore: 'Robbed of his noble lineage, Zhin ruthlessly carved out his own throne atop the criminal underworld. By the time he was a man, he’d won the loyalty of enough thieves, assassins, and corrupt bureaucrats to build his own shadowy empire: the Thousand Hands Guild. Anyone scheming against him has a tendency to vanish in the middle of the night, while those who confront him directly meet their doom at the end of his wicked flaming sword. He refuses to pick a side in the war, as there’s more profit to be made playing them against each other.',
